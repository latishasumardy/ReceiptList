# ReceiptList
Liferay technical challenge

To see all the outputs from the test inputs, please run the main function in Main.java file.

Main.java has another function called receiptList that parses through the given inputs, creates Items objects from that data, and then calls
functions from the Items class to calculate sales tax and item type.

Items.java is a class file that is used in Main.java that stores values from a parsed item input into different instance variables and allows 
you to use getters and setters to get the values stored. Look into the file to see comments of what each function does.
